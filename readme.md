# Prompts

## Overview

**Premise**: Prompts are high-level code. 

Just as traditional programming languages are an implementation tool to interface with a computer, prompts should be treated in the same manner. High-level interfaces allow the user to spend more human capital defining the output's specifications, criteria, and constraints. An example is how languages with type deduction allow the programmer to focus their attention on the algorithm instead of the object that represents it.
